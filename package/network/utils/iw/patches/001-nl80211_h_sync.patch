+ * DOC: VLAN offload support for setting group keys and binding STAs to VLANs
+ *
+ * By setting @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_VLAN_OFFLOAD flag drivers can indicate they
+ * support offloading VLAN functionality in a manner where the driver exposes a
+ * single netdev that uses VLAN tagged frames and separate VLAN-specific netdevs
+ * can then be added using RTM_NEWLINK/IFLA_VLAN_ID similarly to the Ethernet
+ * case. Frames received from stations that are not assigned to any VLAN are
+ * delivered on the main netdev and frames to such stations can be sent through
+ * that main netdev.
+ *
+ * %NL80211_CMD_NEW_KEY (for group keys), %NL80211_CMD_NEW_STATION, and
+ * %NL80211_CMD_SET_STATION will optionally specify vlan_id using
+ * %NL80211_ATTR_VLAN_ID.
