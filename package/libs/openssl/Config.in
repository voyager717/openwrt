		This turns on -DOPENSSL_SMALL_FOOTPRINT.  This will save only
		1-3% of of the ipk size.  The performance drop depends on
		architecture and algorithm.  MIPS drops 13% of performance for
		a 3% decrease in ipk size.  On Aarch64, for a 1% reduction in
		size, ghash and GCM performance decreases 90%, while
		Chacha20-Poly1305 is 15% slower.  X86_64 drops 1% of its size
		for 3% of performance.  Other arches have not been tested.

		Enabling this option increases code size (around 20%) and

		increased by 20%-50% (mipsel & x86).
		AES-GCM is supposed to be 3x faster on x86. YMMV.

		ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD ciphersuite with 256-bit keys,

		The default openssl preference is for AES-GCM before ChaCha, but
		that takes into account AES-NI capable chips.  It is not the
		case with most embedded chips, so it may be better to invert
		that preference.  This is just for the default case. The
