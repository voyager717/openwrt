To build this package, you will need the autoconf/automake tools.

BUILDING FROM SVN SOURCES
--------------------------
aclocal && autoheader && automake -a && autoconf 


BUILDING HASERL (without lua)
-----------------------------
./configure
make
make install

You might need to be root to do the 'make install'.


BUILDING WITH EMBEDDED LUA VM
-----------------------------
If lua 5.1.x dev libraries are already installed, then

./configure --with-lua
make
make install

If lua 5.2.x dev libraries are already installed, then
./configure --with-lua=lua5.2
make
make install

If you don't have the lua dev libraries, or you have 
a different version then:

tar zxvf lua-5.x.x.tar.gz
cd lua-5.x.x
make generic | make posix | make linux | ...
mkdir /tmp/lua
cp src/* /tmp/lua
cd <haserl path>
./configure --with-lua=/tmp/lua --with-lua-headers=/tmp/lua
make
