This is index.info, produced by makeinfo version 6.6 from index.texi.

This program generates a C function that uses _getopt_long_ function to
parse the command line options, to validate them and fills a _struct_.
Thus your program can now handle options such as:

     myprog --input foo.c -o foo.o --no-tabs -i 100 *.class

   And both long options (those that start with -) and short options
(start with - and consist of only one character) can be handled.  For
standards about short and long options you may want to take a look at
the GNU Coding Standards (https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html).

   Gengetopt can also generate a function to save the command line
options into a file, and a function to read the command line options
from a file.  Of course, these two kinds of files are compliant.

   Generated code is commented with Doxygen (https://www.doxygen.org)
comments.

2 Download
==========

You can download it from GNU's ftp site
<ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gengetopt/> or from one of its mirrors
(https://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html).  You can also use https protocol to
benefit from encryption: <https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gengetopt/>.  Binaries

compile your own.

2.1 Anonymous Git Checkout
--------------------------

This project's git repository can be checked out through the following
clone instruction:

     git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gengetopt.git

   Further instructions can be found at the address
<https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gengetopt> and the git repository can
also browsed on-line at
<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gengetopt.git>.

   Please note that this way you will get the latest development sources
of Gengetopt, which may also be unstable.  This solution is the best if
you intend to correct/extend this program.  You should send me patches
against the latest git repository sources.

   If, on the contrary, you want to get the sources of a given release
through git, say, e.g., version X.Y.Z, you must check out the tag
'rel_X_Y_Z'.

   When you compile the sources that you get from the git repository,
before running the 'configure' and 'make' commands, for the first time,
you must run the command:

     autoreconf -i

   This will run the autotools commands in the correct order, and also
copy possibly missing files.  You need to have installed recent versions
of 'automake', 'autoconf' and 'libtool' in order for this to succeed.

2.2 CVS
-------

Since version 2.22.4 of Gengetopt the CVS repository was dismissed in
favor of Git.  The CVS repository is no longer updated or used.
